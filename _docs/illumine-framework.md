<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
The Illumine Framework's dependancy's are managed with Composer, Bower &amp; Node.js. If you're not familar with these tools yet, now would be great time to explore them:
<h3>Composer</h3>
Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/composer-php">Composer PHP on Stack Overflow</a> offers a good collection of Composer related questions.

<h3>Bower</h3>
Bower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesn’t concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.  Refer to Bower's installation instructions to get started and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=bower">Bower on Stack Overflow</a> for more help.

<h3>Node.js</h3>
